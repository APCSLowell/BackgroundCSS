# Adding a background image to your webpage
The styles.css file is used to define the background of your webpage. To use an image rather than a solid color as the background, open your styles.css file and and in the body section, replace the `background-color: rgb(200,200,200);` with code like `background-image: url('Clock.jpg'); background-size:cover;` Make sure that your image, in this case `Clock.jpg` is in the same repository (folder) with all the other files.
